        Michael did a great job on the design for the renovation of my 3 bedroom
        terraced house. His designs were well presented and were done quickly
        and he was very patient and accommodating in making any requested
        changes. The work involved a side return extension to the kitchen and
        opening out of the whole ground floor as well as remodelling upstairs
        from 3 bedrooms to 2 plus en-suite closet and second bathroom. He had
        some great ideas and was always a pleasure to deal with. Michael also
        took full responsibility for negotiating the required party wall
        agreements and liaising with the structural engineer and with local
        authority requirements. He did a lighting and electrical plan for the
        whole building. I found him patient, flexible, calm and very reasonably
        priced. I am very happy with the work he did. <b>Clare F.</b>
